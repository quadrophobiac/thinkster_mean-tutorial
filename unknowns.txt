mean tutorial

the use of angular so far is far more straight fwd than the other tutorial

the tutorial shows how to use ui.router in lieu of ngRoute - compare it against the previous tutorial

differs from creating multiple files for views in favour of creating 'inline templates'
// need to understand why and where one would do this

Both this MEAN tutorial and the Django tutorials avail of this. assignment in their javascript files [what does this mean in Angular vs Express / Node]

__THEORY__

separation of concerns within Angular

in the tutorial you are instructed to write code such that data is stored in the controller (i.e. by only having one controller file)
downsides, the data is difficult to mock, which is important when writing automated tests <- this is NB to JOBS interviews & TDD

In angular, factory and service are related in that they are both instances of a third entity called provider.
