mean tutorial

the use of angular so far is far more straight fwd than the other tutorial

separation of concerns within Angular

in the tutorial you are instructed to write code such that data is stored in the controller (i.e. by only having one controller file)
downsides, the data is difficult to mock, which is important when writing automated tests <- this is NB to JOBS interviews & TDD
