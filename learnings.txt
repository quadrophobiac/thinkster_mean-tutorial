RESTful route mappings go in routes/index.js

Mongo data relationships
In Mongoose, we can create relationships between different data models using the ObjectId type. The ObjectId data type refers to a 12 byte MongoDB ObjectId, which is actually what is stored in the database. The ref property tells Mongoose what type of object the ID references and enables us to retrieve both items simultaneously.

REST - you map actions to routes!
