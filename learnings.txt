NODE

_directories_
public/ - As the name alludes to, anything in this folder will be made publicly available by the server. This is where we're going to store JavaScript, CSS, images, and templates we want the client to use.
^  public is where all Angular client JS is relocated to

views - have a .ejs extension
^ views folder is where all Angular client HTML files are relocated to

RESTful route mappings go in routes/index.js

index.js is where the Express part of the MEAN stack comes into play!

When defining routes with Express.js, two variables will get passed to the handler function: req and res
req = "request": contains all the information about the request that was made to the server including data fields.
res = "response": is the object used to respond to the client.

Mongo

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/debug-news'); - creates a monggoDB database with the name debug-news
a schema doesn't get created until its posted to though

Mongo data relationships
In Mongoose, we can create relationships between different data models using the ObjectId type. The ObjectId data type refers to a 12 byte MongoDB ObjectId, which is actually what is stored in the database. The ref property tells Mongoose what type of object the ID references and enables us to retrieve both items simultaneously.

REST - you map actions to routes!
